# shadePhysics
This Visual Studio 12 C++ 11 project which uses a custom game engine. 
Including an OpenGL 3.3 Graphic System and custom physics system to showcase my knowledge of Game Engine Physics.

The demo (in the Release Folder) shows a scene with a plane with an animated texture and a cloth physics system. 
This was a third year University project by Drew Bowden (@drewbiegames on GitHub)
