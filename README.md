# shadePhysics
This Visual Studio 12 C++ 11 project which uses a custom game engine. 
Including an OpenGL 3.3 Graphic System and custom physics system to showcase my knowledge of Game Engine Physics.

The demo (in the Release Folder) shows a scene with a plane with an animated texture and a cloth physics system. 
This was a University project by Drew Bowden (@drewbiegames on GitHub)

The Engine includes:
 Custom Physics engine.
 Spring Physics System.
 Custom OpenGL 3.3 Graphics Engine using shaders.
 Frame Shader to apply after-image effects.
 3D Self-Coded Math Library.
 XML Parser for custom game states. 
 Templated Factory for every object type (shader, game object, object mesh).
 Game State Machine.
 Collision System.
 Input System using SDL2 and custom event system.
